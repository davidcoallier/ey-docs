#Platform Services

Some platform services are now candidates for testing on Engine Yard Cloud. Read this page, if you want to participate in the platform services Early Access program.

**Note:** This feature requires a full account. If you have a trial account and want to upgrade to a full account, see [[Upgrading free trial account|upgrading-free-trial-to-full-account]].

**Important!** Usage charges for enabled platform services are added to your Engine Yard bill. Review the platform service providers' web sites for pricing.  WHICH ARE FREE?

The following services are available: 

* **[[Airbrake|http://www.airbrake.io/pages/home]]**.  Account level? Configuration necessary but failing now.
* **[[DynECT Managed DNS|http://dyn.com/]]**. Configuration necessary but failing now.
* **[[IronWorker|https://hud.iron.io/]]** Visit but failing now. The link is bad because it requires login -- we don't want customers to create a separate account in addition to the one that gets created for them via Engine Yard, do we? 
* **[[Librato Metrics|https://metrics.librato.com/]]** Failing with a red alert? message
* **[[MongoHQ|https://providers.mongohq.com/home]]** Only the Disable button.
* **[[MongoLab|http://mongolab.com]]** Visit but failing now.
* **[[StatsMix|http://www.statsmix.com/]]** Account level? Configuration necessary but failing now.
* **[[Translation Platform|http://www.oneskyapp.com/i18n-translate/]]** Visit but failing now.
* **[[Tronprint|http://brighterplanet.github.com/tronprint/]]** Only the Disable button.
