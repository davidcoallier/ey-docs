# Monitoring with Airbrake

This page describes setting up and integrating Airbrake with a Rails 3 application. Airbrake collects errors generated by other applications and aggregates the results. Errors are displayed in the a web UI and optionally through an RSS feed. 

<!-- Why should I use Airbrake? What are the alternatives? When should I use one rather than another? -->

You need an Airbrake account. Airbrake offers a several tiers of service, including a free plan and a free trial.

**Note:** Each tier of Airbrake has a different error-rate limit. The error-rate limit for the free tier is 5 errors per minute. Any errors reported to Airbrake after the rate limit is reached are ignored and discarded.
