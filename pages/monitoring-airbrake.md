# Monitoring with Airbrake

Airbrake collects errors generated by other applications and aggregates the results. Errors are displayed in a web UI and optionally through an RSS feed.

This page describes setting up and integrating Airbrake with a Rails 3 application:  

* [Get an Airbrake account][2]
* [Add the Airbrake gem][3]
* [Configure your application to use Airbrake][4]
* [Test Airbrake for your application][5]

<!-- Why should I use Airbrake? What are the alternatives? When should I use one rather than another? -->

<h2 id="topic2"> Get an Airbrake account</h2>

You need an Airbrake account. Airbrake offers several tiers of service, including a free plan and a free trial.

**Note:** Each tier of Airbrake has a different error-rate limit. The error-rate limit for the free tier is 5 errors per minute. Any errors reported to Airbrake after the rate limit is reached are ignored and discarded. 

###To get an Airbrake account

1. Navigate to [[airbrakeapp.com|http://www.airbrakeapp.com]].
2. Sign up for an account.

<h2 id="topic3">Add the airbrake gem </h2>

Add the airbrake gem to your Gemfile in your local environment, and then run bundle install.

###To install the airbrake gem for a Rails 3.x application

<!-- Does this work with Rails 3.1 and 3.0? 
If so, do we need to modify the command? "~> 3.0.rc2" -->

1. Add the latest version of the airbrake gem to your Gemfile, for example:

        gem "airbrake", "~> 3.0.rc2"

2. Run bundle install to update Gemfile.lock:

        bundle install


<h2 id="topic4">Configure your application to use Airbrake</h2>

You need to create a project in Airbrake and add the project's API to your Ruby application. 


###To configure your application to use Airbrake

1. Log into your Airbrake account.

2. Create a project.

3. Copy the API key.  
    ![The API key that appears in step 3 of the Airbrake project](images/airbrake_api_key.png)

2. Run this command in your local Rails root directory:    
        script/rails generate airbrake --api-key API_Key
    
    Where API_Key is the full key (as shown in Step 3).  
    For example:  
        script/rails generate airbrake --api-key 5eb82ba445b692f7dd89ff84c8a551ea

    This script creates a test error that is reported by Airbrake.

3. View the test error to confirm configuration.  

    <!-- Presumably I log into Airbrake and see my error somewhere... -->

<h2 id="topic5">Test Airbrake for your application</h2>

You can test Airbrake for your application at any time by running a command that generates an error. 

###To test Airbrake

<!-- Where do I type this? SSH into my instance -->

1. Type:  
        rake airbrake:test  

<!-- what's the response? -->

[1]: #topic1        "topic1"
[2]: #topic2        "topic2"
[3]: #topic3        "topic3"
[4]: #topic4        "topic4"
